In this chapter, we evaluate the feasibility and performance of various side-channel resistant implementations of the Dilithium signature scheme on embedded devices. We focus on how different countermeasures, specifically masking and shuffling techniques, affect security and efficiency. Through analysis of experimental results from existing studies, we assess the practicality of these implementations for real-world deployment.

\section{Vulnerability Assessment of Dilithium}

Understanding the susceptibility of Dilithium implementations to side-channel attacks is crucial for identifying necessary countermeasures. Table~\ref{tab:attack_surface} summarizes key findings from studies that evaluated the vulnerabilities of unprotected Dilithium implementations.

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Marzougui et al.~\cite{Marzougui22} demonstrated that the bit-unpacking function in Dilithium leaks sensitive information. Using machine learning and integer linear programming on power traces from 756,589 signatures, they fully recovered the secret key component $s_1$, highlighting a severe vulnerability in unprotected implementations.

Pessl et al.~\cite{Pessl19} exploited deterministic patterns in the NTT computations to recover secret keys from a single power trace. By applying factor graph modeling and belief propagation, they showed that the NTT is a significant source of side-channel leakage.

Migliore et al.~\cite{Migliore19} conducted leakage assessments using Welch's $t$-tests and single-bit \ac{DPA} on unprotected implementations. They observed significant leakage with as few as 500 traces, confirming that sensitive information can be extracted without sophisticated attacks.

These studies collectively demonstrate that unprotected Dilithium implementations are highly susceptible to side-channel attacks, necessitating effective countermeasures to ensure security on embedded devices.

\section{Evaluation of Side-Channel Countermeasures}

Various countermeasures have been proposed to mitigate side-channel vulnerabilities in Dilithium. Table~\ref{tab:countermeasures} summarizes these methods, their evaluation approaches, security frameworks, and key findings regarding their effectiveness.

    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Migliore et al.~\cite{Migliore19} implemented high-order masking techniques and evaluated their effectiveness using statistical analysis on 10,000 traces. Their results showed no detectable leakage, confirming the robustness of their countermeasures under the $t$-probing security model.

Azouaoui et al.~\cite{Azouaoui22} refined sensitivity analysis to identify critical operations requiring protection and introduced randomized masking schemes with bitsliced implementations. This approach enhanced leakage protection while improving performance, particularly at higher masking orders.

Coron et al.~\cite{Coron23} developed new masking gadgets, such as the ShiftMod gadget, and validated their security through simulations and formal proofs. Although their implementation incurred higher overheads, it serves as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating strong security under the $t$-SNI model. They suggest that performance can be improved through architecture-specific optimizations and bitslicing.

Ravi et al.~\cite{Ravi20} explored shuffling techniques on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Their evaluations indicated that shuffling reduces traceability, with the level of security improvement varying based on the shuffling method employed.

\section{Performance Impact of Countermeasures}

Implementing side-channel countermeasures in Dilithium directly influences its performance, especially in the signature generation phase. While key generation and other operations are also affected, the signing procedure is typically the most relevant metric for practical deployment. This is because key generation is often performed infrequently (e.g., only once per device or infrequently over the device's lifecycle), whereas signing may be executed repeatedly and under strict time constraints in real-world applications. Therefore, focusing on signing performance provides a more impactful and meaningful measure of how countermeasures affect the user experience and feasibility of deploying Dilithium on embedded platforms.

\subsubsection{Signing Performance}

Figure~\ref{fig:combined_performance_updated} illustrates the normalized execution times for the signing operation with different countermeasures.

\end{figure}

High-order masking, as implemented by Migliore et al.~\cite{Migliore19}, significantly increases execution time due to the overhead of securely processing multiple shares. For instance, masking order 1 (MO-1) incurs approximately 5.68 times the execution time of the unprotected version, while masking order 3 (MO-3) increases it to 28.3 times.

Azouaoui et al.~\cite{Azouaoui22} introduced a more refined masking technique by enhancing sensitivity analysis and employing bitsliced implementations. Their randomized masking scheme reduced overheads, achieving better performance at higher masking orders. For example, at masking order 2 (MO-2), the overhead was reduced to approximately 4.3 times the unprotected implementation, compared to the higher overheads reported by Migliore et al.

Coron et al.~\cite{Coron23} developed novel masking gadgets, including the ShiftMod gadget, which streamlined critical operations within Dilithium. Although their implementation serves as a proof-of-concept with higher overheads (e.g., MO-3 incurs a 28.0× slowdown), they anticipate significant performance improvements through architecture-specific optimizations and bitslicing techniques.

Shuffling techniques, as explored by Ravi et al.~\cite{Ravi20}, offer an alternative or complementary approach to masking. Their shuffling methods introduce randomness to the order of operations, effectively reducing traceability with lower performance overheads. For instance, Coarse-Full Shuffling (CFS) and Coarse In-Group Shuffling (CIGS) increase execution time by about 1.2 times, while Bitwise Fine Shuffling (BFS) incurs a higher overhead of approximately 5.06 times.

\section{Discussion}

The comparative analysis reveals a trade-off between security and performance when implementing side-channel countermeasures in Dilithium. High-order masking provides strong security guarantees under rigorous models like the $t$-probing model but introduces significant performance overheads. This may not be practical for resource-constrained embedded devices without optimization.

Optimized implementations, such as those by Azouaoui et al.~\cite{Azouaoui22}, demonstrate that performance penalties can be mitigated through careful design, bitslicing, and hardware-specific optimizations. By targeting critical operations and employing efficient masking gadgets, they achieved better performance at higher masking orders.

Shuffling techniques offer a balance between security and performance. While they generally provide less robust security compared to high-order masking, they introduce lower overheads and can be effective against certain types of attacks, especially when combined with masking.

Practitioners must consider specific security requirements, performance constraints, and hardware characteristics when selecting countermeasures. The choice between masking and shuffling, or a combination thereof, depends on the desired level of security and acceptable performance impact.
