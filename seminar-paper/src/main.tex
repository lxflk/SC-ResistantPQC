\section*{Abstract}

The advent of quantum computing presents a critical threat to current cryptographic systems, necessitating the development of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) schemes that are resistant to both quantum and classical attacks. While lattice-based schemes like Kyber and Dilithium are prominent candidates for post-quantum security, their susceptibility to side-channel attacks (SCAs) on embedded devices poses additional security challenges. This paper systematically analyzes existing side-channel countermeasures, including masking and bitslicing techniques, which enhance the security of PQC schemes against power and electromagnetic SCAs. We compare implementations with first- and higher-order masking across performance metrics such as execution time and memory usage, revealing trade-offs between security and efficiency. Our findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate countermeasures based on application requirements, emphasizing the potential of optimized high-order masking gadgets and hardware-assisted solutions. This work provides insights into balancing security and performance in resource-constrained environments, supporting the practical deployment of quantum-resistant cryptographic systems.
