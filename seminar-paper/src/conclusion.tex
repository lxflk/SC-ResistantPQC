\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary of Findings}

In this paper, we have analyzed various side-channel resistant implementations of PQC schemes. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of masking and bitslicing techniques in enhancing side-channel resistance while acknowledging the associated performance overheads.

\section{Discussion of Trade-offs}

We have identified trade-offs between security and efficiency. Higher-order masking provides increased security but at the cost of greater computational resources. Implementations must balance these aspects to meet the constraints of embedded devices.

\section{Implications for Deployment}

Our analysis underscores the importance of selecting appropriate countermeasures based on application requirements. Secure and efficient PQC implementations are crucial for the widespread adoption of quantum-resistant cryptography in resource-constrained environments.

\section{Future Work}

Future research could explore optimizing existing countermeasures and developing new techniques to reduce performance overheads. Investigating hardware-assisted solutions and exploring other PQC schemes may also yield valuable insights.
