\section{Motivation}

The advent of quantum computing presents a critical challenge to existing cryptographic systems, especially for widely deployed public-key algorithms, which are vulnerable to quantum-based attacks. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated a standardization process to develop post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms resistant to quantum adversaries. However, these new algorithms must also be secure against classical attack vectors, including side-channel attacks (SCAs), such as power analysis and electromagnetic analysis, which can leak sensitive information during cryptographic operations.

Side-channel resistance is particularly important for implementations on embedded devices, where resources are constrained, and physical access by attackers is more feasible. Lattice-based schemes like Kyber and Dilithium have emerged as leading candidates in the NIST PQC standardization process due to their favorable performance and security properties. However, their resistance to SCAs is an active area of research.

Several studies have explored side-channel countermeasures for these schemes. Migliore et al.\ \cite{Migliore19} investigated masking techniques for Dilithium, providing efficient implementations and side-channel evaluations. Heinz et al.\ \cite{Heinz20} presented a first-order masked implementation of Kyber on ARM Cortex-M4, demonstrating practical side-channel resistance on embedded platforms. Further advancements include higher-order masking schemes \cite{Bos21}, improved masking gadgets \cite{Coron23}, and bitslicing techniques for efficient arithmetic/Boolean masking conversions \cite{Bronchain22}. Azouaoui et al.\ \cite{Azouaoui22} revisited the sensitivity analysis of Dilithium and proposed improved implementations to enhance its side-channel resistance.

Understanding the feasibility and performance of these side-channel resistant implementations is crucial for real-world deployment. This seminar paper aims to systematically analyze and compare existing implementations, focusing on their practicality, security level, and performance overhead on embedded devices.
